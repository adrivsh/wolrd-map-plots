# World map colorer

This project helps you build chloropleth world maps **attempting** to render decently the disputed boundaries.


# Getting started
Download the whole repo and run [draw_maps.ipynb](draw_maps.ipynb).


## depedencies
This script uses Python 3 and some standard librarires (I recommend using the Anaconda python 3 distribution).

The script will produce SVG maps out of the box. 

To tranform these SVGs into PDF or PNG, it requires Inkscape. 
It also produces merged map+legend PNG file if ImageMagick is installed in your machine.
